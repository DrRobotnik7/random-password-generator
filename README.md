## Usage

URL: https://drrobotnik7.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/

Click on the "Generate Password" button. Select a password length from between 8 and 

Hover over various elements to add some colour to the website and take aim at the nefarious Dr.Robotnik!

Click on the buttons in the project cards and you will be directed to the selected web application in a new tab in your browser.

Note that currently only the Portfolio, Horiseon and Prework cards currently point to a valid URL. The other images are placeholders...for now! The cursor will change to a 'not-allowed' cursor when you hover over these placeholders.

## Credits

I used code provided by Bootstrap as a template for the header, navigation bar, jumbotron, portfolio cards and footer.

Many thanks to the EdX team for teaching me the coding skills needed to complete this portfolio and the projects within it. 

I would also like to acknowledge my peers in Sibert-pod-11. We're all on the same learning journey and have helped each other massively during the front-end web development skills boot camp.
